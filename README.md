Planning a cycling trip

## Definition

We have a cycling trip to plan.  We had thought of cycling Nantes to San
Sebastian but this is looking a little ambitious.

An alternative that could be planned quickly would be a cycle round North Wales, perhaps even aiming to cycle to Cardiff as a finish point.

Let's see if we can't flesh out a cycle from Chester to Cardiff via Bangor.

Feedback from the group is that they would rather do London Paris.  This is good as the route we took last year is a cracker.  We will follow a similar route to last year but split the first day and start in central London (St Pancras?).

Let's see what this looks like now ...
