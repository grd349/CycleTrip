**The Ferry**

The only ferry operator is DFDS.  The current cost is £30 per person for
the voyage.  If we want a cabin, inc shower, then that is extra.  For a 4
person cabin the cost is £35.  A commodore cabin for 1 person is £30.  Last
time I had a commodore cabin and I regret nothing.
The current plan is to take the Thursday September 5, 2019 at
17:30 ferry. See `ferry issue <https://github.com/grd349/CycleTrip/issues/2>`_.
